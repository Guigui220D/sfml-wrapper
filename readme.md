# Zig SFML Wrapper

## This is a work in progress! Things work but I want to make pretty classes for everything

This is a wrapper for CSFML. Theres no problem importing CSFML in Zig, but the resulting code can be a little bit messy.
My goal is to make things close enought to SFML, with nice methods.
This is a side project.
